chunkomatic

Basically I got sick of split doing a piss poor job of splitting really
large files.  Yeah, it works, but it lacks all the cryptograhic niceties.

I found myself having to deal with a 100GB file that I needed to send to
someone far away over a crappy connection.  Needless to say, being
able to verify that all the pieces got there really really mattered.

Obviously, this is software written to solve a problem.  Maybe it'll solve
your problem... maybe not... maybe it'll even cause you more problems...
I don't know.  Use at your own risk... if it's doing something weird, read
the code...
